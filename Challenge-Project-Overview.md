>
> We've pre-populated this Challenge Project Overview page — which is what will be shared with your Break Through Tech student team in August — using the details from your submission form. You should have received an email inviting you to join this repo as a Collaborator, enabling you to add files and make edits.
> 
> In order for your project to be finalized and assigned to a team, please:
> 1. **Review all sections below** and update or expand any content as needed, making sure to address the SME Feedback in the section immediately below. Look for square brackets to find the places below that require additional inputs from you (e.g., "About [Company / Org Name]").
> 2. **Add your dataset** to the [data folder](data) in this repo.
> 3. **Close the Issue assigned to you in this repo** to let us know that you have made your edits and the overview page is ready for final review. You can do this by going to the _Issues_ tab in the top left section of the menu above, add a comment that says "CA review complete", and click the button to Close the Issue.

### Project Milestones

Use these milestones to guide your work. Your team will create a **GitHub Projects board** to track tasks within each milestone.

| Month       | Milestone                  | Key Activities                                         |
|-------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **September** | Data Understanding         | Explore dataset, handle missing values, document findings |
| **October**   | Model Development          | Train baseline model, experiment with approaches, iterate |
| **November**  | Evaluation & Presentation   | Finalize model, prepare presentation, document results |

> **Note for the team:** Please create a GitHub Projects board in this repository to break these milestones into weekly tasks. Go to the **Projects** tab → **New project** → Choose **Board** → Add columns for each month.

## 📊 Dataset

**Name and Source:** Real ABS prospectuses (Toyota TALNT, Verizon ABS, Sallie Mae SMB Trust) from SEC EDGAR 424B filings  
**Format:** PDF  
**Size:** unknown  
**Location:** [Link to dataset or instructions for accessing it]

### Key Details
- Real ABS prospectuses from SEC EDGAR 424B filings
- No known limitations or preprocessing needed
- [Link to data dictionary or documentation, if available]

# AI Due Diligence Agent for ABS Prospectuses

**Company / Org:** PIMCO  
**Challenge Advisor:** N/A  
**Program:** Break Through Tech AI Studio - Fall 2026

## 🏢 About PIMCO

PIMCO is a leading global investment management firm, specializing in fixed income and alternative investments. Our focus is on leveraging innovative technology and data analytics to optimize investments and manage risk effectively.

---

## 🎯 The Challenge

### Project Summary
Build a deep agentic AI system using LangChain and LangGraph that autonomously conducts structured due diligence on a publicly available ABS prospectus — breaking a DD checklist into subtasks, retrieving relevant evidence from the document, reasoning through each question, self-evaluating the sufficiency of its answers, and generating a comprehensive cited due diligence report.

### Success Criteria
Agent self-scores (Complete / Partial / Not Found + confidence float), Evaluation against 30 hand-crafted Q&A pairs, and stretch goal completeness score.

## 📋 BTT Internal Evaluation Notes
*(This section is for BTT staff only — remove before sharing with students)*

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Python Compatibility | YELLOW | While the tech stack is predominantly Python, the use of tools like LangChain and LangGraph may introduce additional complexities that require careful integration and understanding from the students. |
| Data Readiness | YELLOW | The status of data readiness is unclear; the actual size and structure of the datasets have not been disclosed, which could lead to challenges in data preparation that need to be assessed at the start of the project. |
| Resource Check | GREEN | No specialized hardware or proprietary software issues are identified in the submission. The tools indicated are available for student access. |

**Student Fit Score:** 5/10  
**Technical Depth Score:** 7/10  
**Overall Recommendation:** REVISE

**Advisor Feedback Draft:**
The proposed project is intriguing with the potential for significant practical applications in the field of AI and finance. However, clarity on data size and structure is essential for a successful student experience. I recommend refining the project scope to better fit the student's current capabilities while allowing for incremental learning.
